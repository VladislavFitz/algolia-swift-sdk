## Install

### Swift Package Manager

The Swift Package Manager is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code.
Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

To use SwiftPM, you should use Xcode 11 to open your project. Click `File` -> `Swift Packages`
-> `Add Package Dependency`, enter `github.com/VladislavFitz/algolia-swift-sdk`

If you're a framework author and use Swift API Client as a dependency, update your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
let package = Package(
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/VladislavFitz/algolia-swift-sdk", from: "0.3.0")
    ],
    // ...
)
```
